        <h2>Intorduction</h2>
        <p>
          Valorant is a 5v5 tactical shooter game developed by riot games
          launched in 2020. In Valorant, each team of 5 players pick an agent
          each from a roster of 15+ agents each with different abilities. The
          main objective of the game is to plant and detonate a device called
          spike by the attacking team on the sites marked on the map.
        </p>
        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>
          The defenders have to stop the attackers from planting the spike or to
          defuse the spike after it is being planted. Defusing the spike or
          defeating all the attackers or defeating all the defenders completes a
          round. After 12 rounds the attacking and defending teams are switched
          and the first team to win 13 rounds wins the game.
        </p>
        <h2>Agents</h2>

        <p>
          There are a lot of agents to choose form in Valorant, with different
          roles and abilities. There are duelist, whose role is to get frags and
          they are generally the use for getting kills. Ten there area
          controllers who are use to hold an area of the map. The role of
          initiator is to start an attack on a site. Sentines are supporting
          characters who are very important in a team as they play a major role
          in prividing support.
        </p>
        <h2>Addictive and many game modes</h2>
        <p>
          It is a fun to play game as it allows us to play with our friends and
          connect with other people playing the game. It requires some time to
          actually get the knack for it and requires some time to master some
          basic mechanical skills but after some hours of playing it feels so
          much fun to play! You would spend hours playing this game without even
          realizing. It also has various other game modes like Deathmatch, Spike
          Rush, Replication etc. which get rotated every 2 weeks.
        </p>

        <h2>Final thoughts</h2>

        <p>
          Overall, it is a very good game and that is the reason why its
          popularity is explosively rising and I think that you should also give
          it a try.
